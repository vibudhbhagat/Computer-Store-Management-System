# Computer-Store-Management-System
I've developed a simple c++ Computer store management system using an object-oriented approach. From the outset, the application demands the user to login as admin or user. Then, proceeding to the main screen, there are choices 
- Take New Computer Order: place order 
- Delete Latest Order(admin only): delete order 
- Print the Receipt: displays receipt. 
- Daily Summary of Total Sale(admin only): display all receipt from that day 
- Payment Gateway:to complete payment of respective orders. 
- Manage Stock:Add or remove Multiple Products.
- Exit: logouts  
The program's main aim is to digitalise most of the common tasks carried out in the store on a regular basis. One can login as a user and place an order for a computer or can login as admin to gain access to other features like deleting a particular order, etc.
